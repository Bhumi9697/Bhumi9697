 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   As a software engineer, my journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Information Science, where I gained a solid foundation in programming and software development concepts. During my studies, I had the opportunity to intern with Bosch in their tool development team. It was an invaluable experience that exposed me to real-world software engineering practices and allowed me to contribute to meaningful projects. The internship went well, and I was fortunate enough to be converted to a full-time software developer role with Bosch. For three years, I worked on various projects, honing my programming skills and collaborating with talented individuals.
However, I felt the need to further expand my knowledge and delve deeper into the field of computer science. Motivated by this desire, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am balancing my academic pursuits while actively seeking opportunities to enhance my skills. Recently, I had the opportunity to complete a co-op/internship as a data engineer at Abacus Insights. This experience not only exposed me to the exciting field of data science but also allowed me to apply my software engineering expertise to build robust data pipelines and analyze large datasets.
Throughout my journey, I have also undertaken self-driven projects to explore new technologies and solve interesting problems. These projects have allowed me to demonstrate my ability to independently conceptualize, design, and implement software solutions.
Now, as I continue my Master's program, I am eager to explore new internship and full-time opportunities in the software engineering and data science fields. I am passionate about leveraging my diverse experiences, combining software development skills with data analysis capabilities, and contributing to innovative projects that have a meaningful impact.
